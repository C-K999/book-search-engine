# [MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine](https://module-last-bse.herokuapp.com/)

This web application is an attempt to refactor a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. A user can type a search term in a search box and the results will appear.

## Code Snippet

The following code provides an outlook in how the model functions, taken from `/server/schemas/typeDefs.js` where the various objects from `/models` are defined and typed.

```
type User {
    _id: ID!
    username: String!
    email: String!
    bookCount: Int
    savedBooks: [Book]
  }
  type Book {
    bookId: String!
    authors: [String]
    description: String
    title: String!
    image: String
    link: String
  }
  type Auth {
    token: ID!
    user: User
  }
```
